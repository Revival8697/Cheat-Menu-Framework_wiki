# What happened to the MCM branch?
It has been moved to it's own dedicated repository and properly archived.

## Why?
To make it clear that that version of the mod is end-of-life and as such is completely unsupported.

## But that's the version of the mod that I liked the most ðŸ˜ 
Feel free to fork the archived repository and make it compatible with whatever version of the game you prefer to play, just as long as the Credits file is left intact, unmodified and in it's current state.
