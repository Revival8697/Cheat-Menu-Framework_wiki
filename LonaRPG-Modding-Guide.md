# Basic LonaRPG Modding Guide

So gonna post a modding guide here since people are having some difficulty, and be warned I might get stuff wrong, but this is how it works for me.

Rules:
1. Some mods do not work with each other
2. Some mods are very outdated and may require a older version of the game to work, so check if the mod was updated for the latest version
3. You MUST launch the game to the title screen once before modding.

Mods being used as an example [Lona Big Booba & Ultra Mod Manager](https://f95zone.to/threads/lonarpg-v0-9-1-0-2-beta-eccma417.49993/post-10907800)

## Step 1: Your Mod Folder

First you will need to open the folder highlighted in red, this is where the majority of modding takes place

This is the modscripts folder, you will see that there's a lot of stuff in here but don't worry, you can ignore a good bunch of it.

The red mark is the _Mods Folder; it's where your mods will be installed [most of the time]

As you can see I already have the two mods Installed in Here.

## Step 2: How To Install

Now I will show you how I installed them.

### In The Case Of The UMM (Ultra Mod Manager) Mod

As you can see by the red lines this mod has two folders: `ModScripts` & `Data`

`Data` modifies the game directly, mods that have this kind of files do some hard modifications for the game, modders usually avoid this so as to not break the game but in this case UMM requires it.

Drop the two folders directly in the main folder and you are done.

Some mods are very easy to install like this, others not.

Some mods you will install directly in the _Mods folder itself, as is the case for the Booba mod.
See `Step 1` on how to locate your folder.

## Step 3: Launching You Mod

The file highlighted in red is the nyx launcher your best friend in installing mods

---

As you can see the launcher is quite simple

For fresh install you may not that your game path is not set

Just click the bar below the game path and select where your game.exe is.

As you can see you can use a load order in your mod. Do NOT mess with it unless the mods explicity tell you to do it, in the case for the one we are using put UMM above Booba (With the examples used, UMM will do this itself automatically if UMM is not at the top of the load order; it does this because it needs to load before everything else)

Once that is done, simply click the play button and you are good to go, but we are not over yet.

## Step 4: Conclusion

Once you start your game it may look like this, that is good you did it correctly, you will see that the mod with the red x on it is not activated, simply press enter or z to activate it and then accept.<br>

Once you are done with that you game should load with no problems, once it finishes.

Make sure that at the bottom near the game version to see if your mod is loaded [as seen in the red marker]

Done you are good to play soldier, you are now free to play.
